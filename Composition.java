/**
 * Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities (or you can say classes) are highly dependent on each other.
 * For e.g. Human and Heart.
 * A human needs heart to live and a heart needs a Human body to survive. In other words when the classes (entities) are dependent on each other and their life span are same (if one dies then another one too) then its a composition. Heart class has no sense if Human class is not present.
 *
 * Java composition is achieved by using instance variables that refers to other objects.
 * For example, a Person has a Job. Letâ€™s see this with a java composition example code.
