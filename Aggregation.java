/**
 * Aggregation Example in Java
 * For example consider two classes Student class and Address class. Every student has an address so the relationship
 * between student and address is a Has-A relationship. But if you consider its vice versa then it would not make any
 * sense as an Address doesnâ€™t need to have a Student necessarily. Lets write this example in a java program.
 * Student Has-A Address
 * <p>
 * The below example shows the Aggregation between Student and Address classes.
 * You can see that in Student class I have declared a property of type Address to obtain student address.
 * Its a typical example of Aggregation in Java.
